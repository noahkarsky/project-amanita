# [Project Amanita Knowledge Graph Visualization](https://noahkarsky.github.io/project-amanita/)

This repo contains the current data I have been building to maintain a bank of information regarding the phenomenon namely UFO/UAP/Extraterrestrial/Ultraterrestrial theory. 
My main inspiration for this approach to study of the phenomenon comes from the great work carried out by ICIJ and their [Offshore Leaks Database](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/)
The data reflects my views alone, and are pulled from many sources, but was started from the fantastic work known as [Loose Threads](https://omega-point.medium.com/loose-threads-af8f652ee8cb)  

  
I will continue to clean and refine the knowledge graph as well as grow it as I continue my research. For updates please follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@noah.karsky8)
